The Smart Waste Management System is an Arduino-based project designed to optimize waste collection and management processes. 
It aims to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and promote environmental sustainability by leveraging IoT (Internet of Things) technology.
Our project incorporates a diverse range of components to create a comprehensive waste management solution. 
By leveraging servo motors, ultrasonic sensors, a moisture sensor, and an I2C LCD display we have developed a  system capable of accurately monitoring waste levels, 
detecting moisture content and providing real-time status updates. 

----->> The servo motors enable precise control over bin lids, ensuring efficient waste containment and disposal. 
----->> Ultrasonic sensors enable non-contact distance measurement, allowing us to gauge the fill level of waste bins with high accuracy.
----->> The moisture sensor enhances our system's capabilities by detecting the presence of liquid waste, facilitating more informed waste management decisions. 
----->> Finally, the I2C LCD display provides a user-friendly interface for local monitoring, allowing users to easily access important information about waste levels and system status. 

The libraries used in this project are uploaded in zip format.
Together, these components form a robust and efficient waste management solution tailored to meet the needs of modern urban environments.
